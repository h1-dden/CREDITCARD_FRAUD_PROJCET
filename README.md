# Credit Card Fraud Detection
This project focuses on building an advanced system using Python, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence techniques to detect fraudulent credit card transactions in real time.

## Dataset

The [CreditCard Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) provided by Kaggle is used in this project. It contains only numerical input variables which are the result of a PCA transformation Features V1, V2, â€¦ V28 are the principal components obtained with PCA, the only features which have not been transformed with PCA are 'Time' and 'Amount'. Feature 'Time' contains the seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset. The feature 'Amount' is the transaction amount.  Feature 'Class' is the response variable and it takes value 1 in case of fraud and 0 otherwise.

## Key Contributions and Achievements
